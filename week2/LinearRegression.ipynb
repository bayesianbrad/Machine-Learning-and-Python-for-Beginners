    "The task of supervised learning is to train a model to predict a label $y$ given an input $x = (x_1, x_2, \\dotsc, x_n)$, where $n$ is the number of input features. For example, $y$ as the target variable can be the price of a house, and $x$ is a vector consisting of $n$ features of the house, such as: the number of bedrooms, proximity to public transport, age of house, etc... Our task then is to build a model that can take these input features of the house and predict the price that the house will be sold at. \n",
    "\n",
    "To train a supervised machine-learning algorithm, you would need a bunch of labelled examples $\\{(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), \\dotsc, (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)})\\}$ which we call the **training data**, where $m$ is the number of datapoints. Using the above example, we would need a dataset containing the sold price of $m$ houses, along with the $n$ features for each of those houses.\n",

    "\n",
    "Linear regression is one of the simplest ML models. It assumes that the mapping from $x$ to $y$ is linear in parameters (i.e. it is composed of the sum of model parameters):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\cdots + \\theta_n x_n + \\epsilon$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the parameter $\\theta_n$ in $\\theta_n x_n$ denotes the slope or how much $y$ is expected to change with each unit change in $x_n$. $\\theta$ can be either positive or negative, e.g. house price is expected to increase by $\\theta_{bed}$ for every extra bedroom, or it is expected to decreased by $\\theta_{transport}$ for every additional meter from a public transport link.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have a $\\theta_n$ for each $x_n$ but we have one more additional term, $\\theta_0$, which we call the bias. This can be interpreted as the *intercept* term, or what $y$ is expected to be in absence of any additional knowledge about $x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that linearity is in parameters $\\theta$, *not* the variables $x$. This means that a linear regression permits polynomials or interactions of original variables, for example:\n",

    "\n",
    "In general linear regression is not the most predictive model out of the box. Nonetheless, it is a very useful baseline in many contexts (and in industry) and benefits from the ease of interpretation and development."
